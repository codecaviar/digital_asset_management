# BingYune & Company LLC
# BingYune & Co - Trademark Guidelines

BingYune & Co supports open source projects.

A list of BingYune & Co's trademarks can be found here: ![Home Page](https://www.bingyune.com). However, that is not a complete list of our names, logos, and brand features, all of which are subject to these guidelines.

If you want to report misuse of a BingYune & Co trademark, please contact us here: support@bingyune.com

* Use BingYune & Co logos in visuals to truthfully refer to and/or to link to the applicable programs, products, services and technologies hosted on BingYune & Co servers.

# When allowed, how should I use a BingYune & Co trademark?

## General Guidelines

**Do:**

* Give a BingYune & Co logo adequate spacing from the other elements on the web page or document (see the BingYune & Co Logo Guidelines below).
* Use the BingYune & Co trademark exactly as shown on our ![Home Page](https://www.bingyune.com).
* Use BingYune & Co wordmarks only as an adjective, never as a noun or verb.

* Don't use BingYune & Co trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.
* Don't use marks, logos, company names, slogans, domain names, or designs that are confusingly similar to BingYune & Co trademarks.
* Don't use BingYune & Co trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by BingYune & Co of your products or services.
* Don't display BingYune & Co trademarks more prominently than your product, service, or company name.
* Don't use BingYune & Co trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc.)

* Don't modify BingYune & Co's trademarks, abbreviate them, or combine them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporate them into a tagline or slogan.

# Additional Guidelines

## Code Distribution Guidelines

Any specific distribution policy in our GitHub repositories contains additional guidelines that apply to the distribution of BingYune & Co code and data products.

## BingYune & Co Logo Guidelines

In addition to the General Guidelines above, your app developer name and everything about your app (including the app name, icon, description, graphics and screenshots) must be unique and free of BingYune & Co trademarks unless (1) you've received prior written permission from BingYune & Co or (2) you're only using a BingYune & Co wordmark to describe that your app works with BingYune & Co's data products and as long as your app icon and/or name:

    * Does not suggest or give the impression your app is actually published by, affiliated with or endorsed by BingYune & Co; and
    * Denotes your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by BingYune & Co.

For example, you cannot name your app “Right Brain Numb3rs NewApp Wrapper”. However, it would be acceptable to name your app "NewApp Wrapper for Right Brain Numb3rs”.

## Social Media Guidelines

In addition to the General Guidelines above, the name and handle of your social media account and any and all pages cannot begin with a BingYune & Co trademark. In addition, BingYune & Co logos cannot be used in a way that might suggest affiliation with BingYune & Co, including, but not limited to, the account, profile, or header images. The only exception to these requirements is if you've received prior permission from BingYune & Co.

For example, you cannot name your account, page, or community “BingYune & Co Representatives” or “Right Brain Numb3rs Program” However, it would be acceptable to name your account, page, or community “Fans of Right Brain Numb3rs” or “Information about BingYune & Co Data” as long as you do not use the Right Brain Numb3rs or BingYune & Co logos or otherwise suggest any affiliation with BingYune & Co.

## Open Source Project Guidelines

The specific license for each of BingYune & Co's data products and shared code says what you can and cannot do with the code itself but does not give permission to use BingYune & Co's trademarks. If you choose to build on or modify BingYune & Co's open source code for your own project,

**You Must:**

* Follow the terms of the Open Source License(s) for BingYune & Co data products and code.
* Choose branding, logos, and trademarks that denotes your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by BingYune & Co.
* Follow the General Guidelines, above.

**You Must NOT:**

* Use any BingYune & Co trademark in connection with the user-facing name or branding of your project.
* Use any BingYune & Co trademark or any part of any BingYune & Co trademark to incorrectly suggest or give the impression your app is actually published by, affiliated with, or endorsed by BingYune & Co. For example, please do not name your project, [Something]-BY&Co, BingYune-[Something], or [Something]-Right-Brain.

**You May:**

* State in words (not using logos or images) that your product "works with" or "is compatible" with certain BingYune & Co data products, if that is true.
* State in words (not using logos or images) that your project is based on BingYune & Co open source technology, if that is true, as long as you also include a statement that your project is not officially associated with BingYune & Co or its products. For instance, you may state that your project: "is proudly built from BingYune & Co's open source data" OR "adapted from BingYune & Co's open source code." Of course, this is only true as long as you also include the statement equally prominently: "[Brand Name] and [Product Name] are not officially associated with BingYune & Co or its products."

## Cloud-based Services

If you offer a cloud-based service that provides remote access to BingYune & Co data products, it is important that you do so in a way that does not confuse users about who is offering the service. You must not use BingYune & Co trademarks in the name of your product or service.

You may state in words (not using logos or images) that your product or service features or provides access to unaltered BingYune & Co data products, if this is true. For example, "[Your Product Name] featuring BingYune & Co's Right Brain Numb3rs data products."

Various permissions to use BingYune & Co Trademarks have been provided to various members of the BingYune & Co Community, and these BingYune & Co Trademark Guidelines do not alter any such previously granted permissions.
